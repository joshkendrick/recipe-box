Ingredients:
* 2 tablespoons coconut oil
* 1 3-inch piece fresh ginger, peeled and thinly sliced, or just ginger powder
* 4 cloves garlic, thinly sliced
* 1 large turnip (about 10 ounces), peeled and cut into ½-inch cubes
* 2 cups shredded kale or other winter greens, can just use 1 bunch from schnuck’s
* 2 teaspoons ground turmeric
* Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper
* 4 cups low-sodium chicken broth
* 1 15-ounce can chickpeas, drained and rinsed
* 3 cups shredded rotisserie chicken (skin removed; about 12 ounces)
   * Just buy 1 rotisserie chicken from schnuck’s. Let cool, then peel
* Fresh lemon juice, to taste
* Whole-wheat naan bread, warmed for serving

Directions:
1. Heat the coconut oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Stir in the ginger and garlic; cook until the ginger softens and the garlic just starts browning, about 3 minutes.
2. Add the turnip and kale and cook, stirring occasionally, until the kale is wilted, about 4 minutes
3. Add the turmeric and ½ teaspoon each salt and pepper; stir until the vegetables are coated and add the chicken broth and 3 cups water
4. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to a simmer and cook until the turnip is just tender, about 10 minutes
5. Add the chickpeas and chicken to the pot. Increase the heat to medium high and return the soup to a simmer
6. Cook until the chicken is warmed through, about 5 minutes. 
7. Season with salt, pepper, and a squeeze of lemon juice. Serve with warmed naan
