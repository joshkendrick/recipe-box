Ingredients:
* 1.5 lbs boneless skinless chicken breasts
* 2 tbsp buffalo wing sauce, and more
* 3 tbsp light sour cream
   * Should double this and next 5 ingredients to get enough dressing
* 1.5 tbsp water
* 1 tbsp mayo
* 1 tbsp freeze dried chives
* 1 tsp white or red wine vinegar
* ¼ tsp garlic powder
   * Last dressing ingredient
* 6 cups chopped romaine hearts (or just buy one big bunch of romaine lettuce)

* ¾ cup halved cherry tomatoes
* Cucumbers
* 1 large celery rib, sliced
* 1 tsp and 2 tbsp olive oil (or 4 tbsp olive oil if doubling dressing)
* Salt and pepper

Directions:
1. Grill chicken (I just grilled it like the grill says on Saturday, then let it cool, put it in fridge, sliced and mixed it with wing sauce later in the week)
   1. Heat grill to medium-high
   2. Rub 1 tsp oil on chicken, season with salt
   3. Grill on both sides until cooked through, 6-7 minutes per side
1. Chicken to cutting board, brush with wing sauce, let rest 5 minutes, cut into slices
2. In small bowl, whisk 2 tbsp oil, sour cream, water, mayo, chives, vinegar, garlic powder, and salt
3. Warm some chicken, serve over lettuce with dressing, maybe tomatoes, croutons, crackers
