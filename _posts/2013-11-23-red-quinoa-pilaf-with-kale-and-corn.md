Ingredients:
* 1 cup red quinoa, buy it pre-rinsed or no rinse needed
* 3 cups veggie broth
* 1 bunch Kale (~8 ounces)
* 1 bunch of green onions
* 2 cups cooked fresh corn kernels
* 2 jarred roasted red peppers, cut into strips
* 2 tablespoons lemon juice
* 2 tablespoons olive oil
* 4 to 6 cloves garlic
* 1 teaspoon paprika
* 1 teaspoon ground cumin
* ½ teaspoon rosemary
* salt
* pepper

Directions:
1. Combine the quinoa and broth in a medium saucepan.
2. Bring to a rapid simmer, then cover and simmer gently until the broth is absorbed, about 15 to 20 minutes. If the quinoa isn’t done, add additional ½ cup of broth (or water) and continue to cook until absorbed
3. Strip the kale leaves away from the stems. Discard the stems, or slice them thinly. Cut leaves into narrow strips, rinse well in a colander
4. cook the corn (i usually buy a can and heat it up with butter in a saucepan)
5. heat oil in a large skillet, add garlic and saute over low heat until golden
6. add the kale to the garlic, stir it, raise heat to medium and cook until wilted, about 2 to 3 minutes
7. add all the other ingredients and cook, stirring frequently for about 4 to 5 minutes longer
