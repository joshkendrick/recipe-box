Ingredients:
* 2 frozen chicken breasts (THAW THEM OUT), cut into 1 inch cubes
* 1 teaspoon cumin
* salt
* pepper
* 2 tablespoons olive oil
* 1 can pinto beans
* ¾ cup (6 oz) green enchilada sauce
* tortillas (maybe 12 corn, warmed)
* Feta or cotija (not necessary, just a topping)
* ¼ small red onion, sliced (it’s a topping)

Most recent time I made this, i used 3 larger breasts, can pinto beans and half can of cannellini beans, and 1 10 oz can green enchilada sauce

Directions:
1. Heat oil in large skillet over medium-high heat
2. Add chicken and cumin, cook 5-7 minutes
3. Add the beans and enchilada sauce
4. Cook, stirring occasionally, until cooked through and beans are hot, ~4-6 more minutes
5. Make tacos with chicken mix, tortillas, onions, feta/mexican or both
