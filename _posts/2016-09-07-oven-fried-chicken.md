Brines all day before cooking for an hour

Ingredients:
* 3 tablespoons salt
* 8 bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs
* 2 tablespoons butter
* Â½ cup all purpose flour
* 1 teaspoon pepper

Directions:
1. In the morning, combine 2 tablespoons salt and a cup of warm water in a large bowl. Stir to dissolve
2. Trim the chicken of excess fat and skin and add to the bowl
3. Cover with very cold water and add some ice cubes -- swish to disperse. Put in the fridge
4. Preheat oven to 400
5. Remove the chicken and pat dry with paper towels
6. Put the butter in a pan large enough to fit the chicken in one layer and not too crowded and place it in the oven to melt the butter.
7. In gallon freezer bag, mix flour, salt and pepper and shake it.
8. Add the chicken 2 pieces at a time and shake until thoroughly coated. When you remove them to place them in the pan shake them off vigorously.
9. Lay them in the roasting pan skin side down
10. Oven-fry until chestnut brown and crisp on the bottom, about 40 minutes, plan on 1 hour.
11. Then flip and cook the other side, around 20 minutes, plan for 30 -- until the bottom is browned again
