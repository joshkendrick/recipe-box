Ingredients:
* 1 ½ pounds skinless, boneless chicken breasts (about 3 medium)
* ½ cup sliced pickled okra, plus ¼ cup brine
* 3 scallions (1 cut into thirds, 2 chopped)
* 2 tablespoons chopped fresh dill, plus 2 whole sprigs (I just used dill weed in the bottle)
* 4 cups coleslaw mix, about 8 ounces
* 3 tablespoons apple cider vinegar
* 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
* May need other dressings for the slaw
* Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper
* 4 whole-wheat sesame hamburger buns, split
* ½ cup chili sauce (such as Heinz, not sriracha)
* 1 tablespoon molasses
* 1 tablespoon yellow mustard
* May need more of the above to make a good bbq taste; plum sauce, actual bbq sauce

Directions:
1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees
2. Place the chicken in a medium saucepan and add 2 cups water, the okra brine, large scallion pieces and dill sprigs. Bring to a boil over high heat
3. Reduce the heat to a simmer and partially cover
4. Simmer until the chicken is just cooked through, about 15 minutes
5. Meanwhile, toss the coleslaw mix, pickled okra and the chopped scallions and dill in a medium bowl
6. Add 2 tablespoons vinegar and 1 tablespoon olive oil, season with the salt and pepper and toss, set aside
7. Brush the buns with the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil, place on a baking sheet and bake until lightly toasted, about 5 minutes
8. Reserve ½ cup poaching liquid, then drain the chicken and transfer to a cutting board. Shred the chicken with 2 forks and return to the pot. 
9. Add the chili sauce, molasses, mustard, the remaining 1 tablespoon vinegar and ¼ cup of the reserved poaching liquid. 
10. Cook over medium heat, stirring, until warmed through, 2 to 3 minutes, adding the remaining poaching liquid as needed if the chicken is too drive
11. Pile the pulled chicken on the buns and serve with the slaw
