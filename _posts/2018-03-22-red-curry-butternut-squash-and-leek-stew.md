Ingredients:
* 2 cups leeks, white and light green parts, sliced into 1/3" rounds
* 1 lrg butternut squash, peeled, cubed (about 7 cups)
* 1 qt (4 cups) unsalted chicken broth
* 1/2 cup cilantro, chopped
* 1 14 oz can coconut milk
* 3 tbsp red curry paste
* 2 tbsp minced ginger
* ground mint
* 2 tbsp lime juice
* 2 cloves garlic, minced
* 2 tbsp vegetable oil

Directions:
1. In dutch oven, heat oil over medium
2. Add leeks, ginger, garlic, salt
3. Cook 3 minutes
4. Stir in curry paste, cook 1 minute
5. Add squash, broth, 1/2 tsp salt
6. Cover, bring to gentle boil
7. Cook 20 minutes until squash is tender. Add broth/water if necessary (wasnt for me)
8. When squash is done, use back of spoon to break up half of the squash. You want soup to be smooth, also chunky (you don't have to break up much)
9. Stir in coconut milk and lime juice. Add salt, lime juice as needed
10. Serve with cilantro, mint, peanuts sprinkled on top
