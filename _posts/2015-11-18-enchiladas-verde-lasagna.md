Ingredients:
* 4 cups store bought salsa verde
* 18 small corn tortillas
* 1.5 lbs butternut squash, peeled and sliced ¼ inch thick
* 1 can black beans, drained and rinsed
* 3 cups mexican cheese
* sour cream/cilantro/jalapenos for topping

Directions:
1. Preheat oven to 375
2. Spread 1 cup of the salsa in a 9x13 baking dish
3. top with 6 tortillas
4. top with 1 cup of the salsa, a third of the butternut squash, a third of the beans, and 1 cup of the cheese, spreading evenly
5. Repeat layering 2 more times, but withhold the final 1 cup of cheese
6. Cover with foil
7. Bake for 1 hour, until the squash is tender
8. Uncover and sprinkle the last cup of cheese
9. Broil 8 inches from the heat for 2-3 minutes, until bubbling and browned in spots
10. Remove from oven and let stand 15 minutes
11. Top with ingredients if you want, and serve

Can bake now and reheat later:
1. Bake according to the recipe, save garnishes until it’s time to serve
2. Cool the dish fully
3. Wrap tightly in plastic then foil. Use 2 layers of foil if storing more than a month
4. Freeze for up to 4 months, or refrigerate for up to 4 days
5. Thaw overnight in the refrigerator so the dish heats evenly
6. Reheat in a 325 oven until warmed through (25-45 minutes).
   1. To test: a spoon inserted into the middle of the dish should feel warm to the lips
