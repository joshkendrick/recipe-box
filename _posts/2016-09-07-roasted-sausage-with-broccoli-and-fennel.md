Can easily double this for 2 pans worth of food. One pan doesnt make much since you shouldnt cram it all in

Ingredients:
* 1 lb turkey sausage, not the kielbasa
* 1 big head of broccoli, cut into florets
* 1 fennel bulb, trimmed, cored, and cut into then slices, Â¼ inch thick
* 3 tablespoons olive oil
* 2 teaspoons whole-grain mustard
* 2 teaspoons lemon juice

Directions:
1. Preheat oven to 425
2. Combine broccoli and fennel in shallow dish -- snug, single, even layer
3. Season with salt and pepper
4. Combine olive oil, mustard, and lemon juice
5. Add to broccoli and fennel and stir to coat evenly
6. Add sausage and nestle it into veggies
7. Roast for 20-ish minutes until sausage is no longer pink
8. Turn broiler on low and do that for like 5 minutes
