Ingredients:
* 2 15 oz cans of chickpeas (~3 cups), drained and rinsed
* 2 stalks of celery, diced (I hate celery and used a yellow pepper last time and it made it pretty good. a little runnier, but good)
* 1/4 cup diced red onion
* 1/4-1/3 cup mayo, miracle whip, or veganaise
* 1 heaping tablespoon dill relish
* 1 heaping tablespoon dijon mustard
* freshly cracked black pepper

Directions:
1. place chickpeas in a large bowl and lightly mash (some will be whole, some will be smashed)
2. stir in celery and onion
3. Then add the mayo, relish and mustard and pepper to taste. Mix well, serve.
