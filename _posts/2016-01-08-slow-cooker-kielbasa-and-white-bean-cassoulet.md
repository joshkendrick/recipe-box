Ingredients:
* 1.5 cups dried white beans (such as great northern or navy, about 8 oz)
* 1 lb kielbasa, cut into 1-inch pieces (I used turkey kielbasa)
* 3 cups chicken broth
* 1 15 oz can diced tomatoes and juices
* 1 med yellow onion, finely chopped
* 2 cloves garlic, finely chopped
* 2 teaspoons chopped thyme leaves
* salt
* black pepper
* 8 ½ inch slices of baguette, buttered, toasted, and cut into cubes
* ¼ cup chopped parsley

Directions:
1. Combine beans, kielbasa, broth, tomatoes, onion, garlic, thyme, and ½ teaspoon salt in crock pot
2. Cover and cook until beans are tender and creamy, low 7-8 hrs (check after 7) (but it’s like 8-9 hours), or on high for 5.
3. Season with salt and pepper
4. Serve the cassoulet topped with baguette cubes and parsley
