<h1>Recipe Box</h1>

<ul>
	<li>I buy whole portions of things; onions, peppers, cucumbers, carrots, etc.</li>
	<li>I don't measure spices, I kind of just guess/estimate.</li>
	<li>Most of these recipes make enough for 2 people for 2-3 full meals.</li>
	<li>We're not big on mushy/runny foods, and I cook meat until it's good and done.</li>
</ul>
